# Introduction
3 slides
slide 1:
only talk about Human-in-the-loop
we're seeing more and more hitl apps
pokemon go, google glass
the ambission of the work is to target all human in the loop
how to get this to work in an automated scalable fashion
all work with same principle
apps in circle, human loop in middle

slide 2:
problem statement
customers: app developer and system design, researchers

app developer: debug, resource consumptions, interaction vs infrastructure, optimization

system designers (infrastructure providers):
interaction (scaling) 

How do I study these factors?
Problems:
- costs (hiring people)
- repeatability

don't make HARD statements
say it's an important topic

slide 3:
related work
cite zhou, but we don't have systematic knowledge
another argument for work
we know so little because there's no methodological approach
mathematical approach is unpractical

present contributions

slide 4:
narrow down to cognitive assistancea
task model

slide 5:
general approach (trace based)

implementation
